â€” About

The main motivation for collecting and publishing this dataset is to assist researchers working on machine learning based approaches for pXRD analysis. Any data, even unlabeled data, can provide clues how simulations can be made to better reflect real world experiments and labeled data can be used to test developed algorithms. We hope to provide both types of data in a wide variety and large quantity.
